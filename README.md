# PLKT: Probabilistic Logical Knowledge Tracing

PLKT is an interpretable Knowledge Tracing (KT) framework that reframes student performance prediction as a goal-conditioned evidence reasoning process over historical learning behaviors. Unlike conventional "black-box" sequence models, PLKT provides transparent reasoning paths, revealing how and why specific past interactions influence each prediction.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Beta Embedding**: Instead of representing knowledge states as deterministic vector embeddings, PLKT employs robust Beta-distributed probabilistic embeddings to represent student knowledge states.
- 🧠 **Multi-level Pattern Extraction**: We propose a multi-level pattern extraction mechanism to explicitly capture learning behaviors at different temporal granularities.
